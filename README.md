TRACK IT ALL

Description:
Helps us to track nearly all of our day to day activity and analyze our habits.

Using Flask ( micro web framework written in Python ) I am trying to buil a simple web application which can track our day to day life activities like running, mood, intake calories and lots of other things.
Along with Flask i have used flask-sqlalchemy to query/connect to the database and flask-wtforms etc..

How to run the program


##open file brower and locate the code file / download it (.zip format available in replit.com)
##if the file is in .zip format unzip it to find main.py and a folder my_app 
*open the code on your choice of editor or in the terminal 
*create a virtual environment and activate it 
*take the main.py file outside of the folder my_app

*install all the packages written in my_app/command.txt
*after the installation is completed you can run the application make sure you are in the file with main.py and my_app folder
